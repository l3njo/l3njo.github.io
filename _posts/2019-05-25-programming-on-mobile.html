title: "Programming on mobile devices"

---


<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mobile devices have evolved far past the two-way radios they began as all those decades ago. Today's mobile phone is powered by a multi-core multi-threaded CPU coupled to generous amounts of memory and storage. That fact, in addition to ever evolving networking technologies, adapts the mobile phone to tasks that even some mid-range PCs may struggle with. It is common to see mobile devices today used for AAA gaming, HD - and even UHD - entertainment and everything in between.</p>

<p>Software development can at times be a very hardware-intensive task. Some development tools have outrageous hardware requirements that have restricted their use to PCs. However, in an age where the mobiles have grown to rival laptops and desktops, I do believe these tools will soon be available for your mobile phone.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Below is a list of a few basic tools that can get you started programming on your phone as we await that time. All the tools on this list are free, open-source and actively maintained. At the time of writing, none of them are known to contain ads.</p>

<h2>1. Keyboard</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you ask any professional developer what the most important piece of hardware in his line of work is, chances are his response will be: "the keyboard". It is only fair that we translate that over to this context and invest in a proper <em>software</em> keyboard.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>BeHe Keyboard</strong> is a modern, practical application that seems like it was built for the task; it's features including arrow keys, a full range of function keys and a "programming mode".</p>

<h2>2. Text Editor</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A text editor is usually the very first thing that pops into mind when one thinks about programming, with good reason as it is the backbone of most IDEs and advanced development tools.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Enlightened</strong> text editor is a simple, no-frills text editor that sports a dedicated tab key in the toolbar. The developers are working on including custom highlighting functionality for different kinds of files.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>3. File Explorer</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most Android devices include a system file explorer bundled in. Due to the customizability of the OS, these vary from device to device As such, yours may not have the functionality you want.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Amaze</strong> file manager is a robust application that is vaguely reminiscent of another paid tool. It includes a built in FTP client and server to get your files between devices quickly. Like the rest of this list, it is completely free. However accessing your cloud accounts requires the purchase of an add-on (KES. 200 at time of writing).</p>

<h2>4. Git Client</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every developer has some form of version control in their projects. Most are familiar with git as a way to accomplish this. Some innovative developers have now brought git to mobile devices.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>MGit</strong> is an android application that enables the full functionality of git on a mobile device. However this functionality is implemented in a material GUI, which seems like an upgrade over the terminal interface most people are familiar with.</p>

<h2>Honorary Mention</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="GitPod (opens in a new tab)" href="https://gitpod.io" target="_blank">GitPod</a> is a game-changer in the software development field. It is an online IDE based in the familiar VS Code interface. A variety of command line tools like Docker are also pre-installed and available to use. However, the term "online IDE" doesn't really do GitPod justice. GitPod is capable of creating a workspace from any GitHub link, by simply appending "https://gitpod.io/#" to any GitHub link. This means you can walk into a cyber caf√©, complete your project and submit it without ever installing any software.</p>
